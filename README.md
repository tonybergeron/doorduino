doorduino
=========

Arduino code for home and managing the door opening

Relies heavily on the https://github.com/sirleech/Webduino/ code to create the webserver.

Returns a webpage (jquery mobile) for the phone to click a button to tell the server to open the door. 

Checking Out: Check this out into your Arduino folder.  Since the sketch name is doorduino, it needs to be in a folder called "doorduino" as well for the sketch to compile and pushed
